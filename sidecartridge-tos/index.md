Welcome to the SidecarTridge TOS Documentation! This comprehensive guide provides detailed information about the SidecarTridge TOS emulator for the Atari ST series of computers. Please refer to the relevant sections below to explore specific topics.

## Introduction

The SidecarTridge TOS emulator is a custom board designed to emulate the internal ROMs of the Atari ST series through bit-banged emulation. This emulator allows users to access any available TOS version and load custom ROMs without the need to physically swap ROM chips. This flexibility includes the capability to run EmuTOS, an open-source TOS replacement.

### Key Features

- **Compact Design**: The board measures just 5cm x 2cm x 0.7cm, making it a perfect fit inside the Atari ST case.
- **Seamless Integration**: Powered by the Atari ST 5V rail, the board communicates with the internal Atari ST bus to provide the necessary signals to the motherboard. The computer will boot as usual, without any modifications other than replacing the ROM chips with the SidecarTridge TOS emulator.
- **Easy Installation**: Users can close the Atari ST case after installation, ensuring a clean and unobtrusive setup.

### Installing and Using the SidecarTridge TOS Emulator

1. **Connect and Copy**: To install a new TOS version, connect the SidecarTridge TOS emulator to a computer via USB. The emulator will appear as a USB mass storage device, allowing users to simply copy the TOS image file to the device.
2. **Select and Reboot**: Launch a program on the Atari ST computer to select the desired TOS version from the available list. After making a selection, reboot the computer to apply the new TOS version.

The SidecarTridge TOS emulator streamlines the process of managing and updating TOS versions on the Atari ST, offering a modern and efficient solution for enthusiasts and developers alike.
