# SidecarTridge Power Supply Unit

The PSU for Atari ST is a modern, solderless replacement power supply unit designed for Atari ST, STE and MegaST computers. Over time, the original PSU components in these vintage systems can deteriorate, leading to unstable voltage output, erratic behavior, or even damage to the motherboard and other internal parts. The PSU for Atari ST addresses these issues by providing a stable and reliable power source, ensuring the longevity and safe operation of your retro computer. It is particularly recommended for SidecarTridge users to avoid failures related to the aging power supply.

This replacement PSU is based on the reliable Mean Well RPD-60, known for its efficiency and stability. The kit includes all necessary components for a straightforward, solderless installation: a custom riser board, connectors, screws, and a specialized cable for seamless connection to the Atari ST motherboard and AC power plug. The riser board ensures the new PSU fits perfectly in the original PSU's location, maintaining the correct alignment and positioning within the computer. This thoughtful design makes the installation process easy and ensures that your Atari ST runs smoothly and reliably for years to come.
